{"name":"UBADDAS","tagline":"User Behavior and Domain Driven Acceptance Stories","body":"*This test framework concisely and coherently brings together the concepts of User Stories, Behaviour Driven Development, and Domain Driven Design. It simply provides a means to author test steps as Personas for each Entity Command. It executes these methods targeting the application layer of choice, resulting in succinct output of test results to the console.  The results are abstract and reusable behaviours that do not need to be rewritten to support other application layers and even different platform implementations.*\r\n\r\nA C# Test Framework combining\r\n* As A, I Want, So That (User Stories)\r\n* Given, When, Then (BDD)\r\n* Entities and Personas (DDD)\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n* Concise - combines test method naming with User Story and BDD syntaxes\r\n* Guiding - following test driven development with strict structure helps discover the domain entities and commands\r\n* Readable - single appropriately named methods result in simple to read tests and output\r\n* Reusable - target testing against different application layers or even platform implementations\r\n\r\nExample console output\r\n```C#\r\nI want to register a new user\r\n  So that Increase customer base\r\n       As user\r\n    Given Register customer\r\n     When Confirm customer registration\r\n     Then Login customer\r\n```\r\nUsage - Test Code\r\n```C#\r\nnamespace TestProject\r\n{\r\n  [TestClass]\r\n  public class MyTest : StoryFeatureBase<MyBusinessValue>\r\n  {\r\n    public override string ApplicationLayer()\r\n    {\r\n      return \"PresentationLayer\"; //could be other i.e. WebApi, possibly provided by App.Config\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    [Test]\r\n    public void IWantToRegisterANewUser()\r\n    {\r\n      var user = new User();\r\n      ICustomer customer = new Customer();\r\n      SoThat(MyBusinessValue.IncreaseCustomerBase)\r\n        .As(user)\r\n        .Given(customer.Register)\r\n        .When(customer.Confirm_Registration)\r\n        .Then(customer.Login);\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    public enum MyBusinessValue\r\n    {\r\n      IncreaseCustomerBase\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace TestProject.Personas\r\n{\r\n  public partial class User : IPersona\r\n  {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace TestProject.Personas.PresentationLayer\r\n{\r\n  public partial class User : ICustomer\r\n  {\r\n    public Customer Customer { get; set; } //injected by framework\r\n    public void Register()\r\n    {\r\n      // your test code here. i.e. selenium\r\n      var email = Customer.Email; //i.e. For registering with app\r\n    }\r\n    // other interface implementations\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace TestProject.Personas.WebApi\r\n{\r\n  public partial class User : ICustomer\r\n  {\r\n    public Customer Customer { get; set; } //injected by framework\r\n    public void Register()\r\n    {\r\n      // your test code here. i.e. rest api calls\r\n    }\r\n    // other interface implementations\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsage - Production Code\r\n```C#\r\npublic interface ICustomer {\r\n  void Register()\r\n  void Confirm_Registration();\r\n  void Login();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Customer : ICustomer {\r\n  public void Register() {\r\n    // your application domain logic\r\n  }\r\n  // other interface implementations\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-51867826-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
